pytrnsys
========

The pytrnsys package provides a complete python-based framework to run, process, plot, and report TRNSYS simulations.
It is designed to give researchers a fast, fully automatized, and reproducible way to execute and share TRNSYS
simulations by the use of a single short configuration file. In addition, a large variety of commands is accessible
to post-process simulation results in one shot. This functionality extends beyond processing TRNSYS generated data and
can also be used for generic data.

The package was developed at the `SPF - Institute for Solar Technology <https://www.spf.ch/>`_ at the `OST - Eastern
Switzerland University of Applied Sciences <https://www.ost.ch/>`_.

A first version of this package was created in 2013 and since then it has evolved considerably.
We would like to thank the Swiss Federal Office Of Energy (SFOE) who supported many projects related to simulations of
renewable energy systems where this code has been developed. We would also like to thank the European Unionâ€™s Horizon
2020 research and innovation programme for the funding received in TRI-HP under the Grant Agreement No. 81488. This
project allowed to dedicate efforts in sharing the code with the consortium and to make the code usable for the others.
