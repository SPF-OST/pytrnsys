Welcome to the pytrnsys documentation!
======================================

The pytrnsys package provides a complete framework to run and process, plot and report
TRNSYS simulations. It is designed to give researchers a fast,
fully automatized and easily reproducible way to execute and share TRNSYS simulations by the use of a single short
configuration file. In addition, a large variety of commands is accessible
to post-process simulation results in one shot.
For more details checkout the :any:`reference <pytrnsys>`.

About
-----
This code was not initially developed with the intention to be shared with others outside our institute SPF,
but after realizing that it could help the community to have a better workflow with TRNSYS, we decided to share it.

A first version of this package was created in 2013 and since then it has evolved considerably.
We would like to thank the Swiss Federal Office Of Energy (SFOE) who supported many projects related to simulations of
renewable energy systems where this code has been developed. We would also like to thank the European Unionâ€™s Horizon
2020 research and innovation programme for the funding received in TRI-HP under the Grant Agreement No. 81488. This
project allowed to dedicate efforts in sharing the code with the consortium and to make the code usable for the others.
