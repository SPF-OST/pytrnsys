Welcome to the user guide for PyTrnsys. The pytrnsys tool provides basic functionality 
written in python to run and process, plot and report TRNSYS simulations. Nevertheless, 
many functions can be used to process and plot other kind of data such as those extracted 
from monitoring systems or exported from other softwares like Polysun.
For more details checkout the :any:`reference <pytrnsys>`.
