Pytrnsys-tutorial
=================

If you correctly installed pytrnsys and were able to use the two commands ``pytrnsys_run``
and ``pytrnsys_process`` you already simulated and processed your first system with TRNSYS.
But most likely you would like do adapt the example system two your weather data and to your
demand profile, excecute other parametric studies, use different system sizing, analyse other
simulation results etc. In this tutorial you learn how to do all this and much more.

Create your own local system
